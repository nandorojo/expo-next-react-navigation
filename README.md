# ü•≥ This library has moved to `solito`!

Exciting news: the future of this library will be [solito](https://github.com/nandorojo/solito). I completely changed the API and approach into something much more scalable and simple, so I decided to make a new library altogether.

This change is a result of my thinking on [#68](https://github.com/nandorojo/expo-next-react-navigation/issues) about the future API.

If you're already using `expo-next-react-navigation`, don't stress. You can continue to use it as you please. But I recommend using solito, even if you're incrementally adopting it. 

I have *tons* of code using `expo-next-react-navigation` in my own app, and I won't be able to change it overnight. But going forward, all new navigation code I write will use solito instead.

While this repo will of course stay up, I will probably no longer make updates to `expo-next-react-navigation`.

## Expo + Next.js Router + React Navigation ü•≥

A set of hooks that wrap the `react-navigation` API that you're used to, and make it work with `next/router`.

This library helps me use the [Expo + Next.js integration](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/guides/using-nextjs/) without stressing about navigation.

## Next.js Conf

## Set up

**Before continuing**, I highly, highly recommend using [this monorepo](https://github.com/axeldelafosse/expo-next-monorepo-example) as your starter.

The steps below are copied from Expo's docs essentially. 

However, the monorepo above is much more updated, and it works with Next.js 11, Webpack 5, and React Navigation v6 üòé

If you use the monorepo, you don't need to do the setup below.

----

**Step 0. Install next with expo:**



- Init: `expo init` (or `npx create-next-app`)

- Install: `yarn add @expo/next-adapter`

- Install next: `yarn add next`

- Configure: `yarn next-expo`

- Start: `yarn next dev`

_I recommend becoming familiar `next`'s architecture with `expo`. Follow the [Expo docs](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/guides/using-nextjs/) or see [this article](https://dev.to/evanbacon/next-js-expo-and-react-native-for-web-3kd9) by Evan Bacon if you're curious._

**Step 1. Edit/create next.config.js**

```bash
yarn add next-compose-plugins next-fonts next-images next-transpile-modules
```

**Step 2: edit `next.config.js` to look something like this:**

```es6
/* eslint-disable @typescript-eslint/no-var-requires */
const { withExpo } = require('@expo/next-adapter')
const withFonts = require('next-fonts')
const withImages = require('next-images')
const withPlugins = require('next-compose-plugins')

const withTM = require('next-transpile-modules')([
  'expo-next-react-navigation',
  // you can add other modules that need traspiling here
])

module.exports = withPlugins(
  [withTM, withFonts, withImages, [withExpo, { projectRoot: __dirname }]],
  {
    // ...
  }
)
```

**All done! Run `yarn next dev` & open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)** üëª

- Take a look at the [next tutorial](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-dynamic-pages) for creating pages.

_You can add other packages that need transpiling to the `transpileModules` array. See [this post](https://forums.expo.io/t/next-js-expo-web-syntaxerror-unexpected-token-export-with-npm-module/31127) for details._

## Usage

Replace the following instances in your code after installation and setup:

### `useNavigation` üëâ `useRouting`

```diff
-import { useNavigation } from 'react-navigation-hooks'
+import { useRouting } from 'expo-next-react-navigation'
```

### `useLayoutEffect`

```diff
-import { useLayoutEffect } from 'react-navigation-hooks'
+import { useLayoutEffect } from 'expo-next-react-navigation'
```

### `<TouchableOpacity />` üëâ `<Link />`

```diff
-import { TouchableOpacity } from 'react-native'
+import { Link } from 'expo-next-react-navigation'

-<TouchableOpacity onPress={() => navigate({ routeName: 'chat' })}>
-  <Text>Go</Text>
- </TouchableOpacity>
+<Link routeName="chat" params={{ roomId: 'hey!' }}>
+  Go
+</Link>
```

All set ‚ö°Ô∏è

# API

## `useRouting`

React hook that wraps `useNavigation` (from react-navigation) hook and `useRouter` (from next-router).

It follows the [same API](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/en/next/use-navigation.html) as `useNavigation`.

```es6
import { useRouting } from 'expo-next-react-navigation'

export default function App() {
  const { navigate, push, getParam, goBack } = useRouting()


}
```

### `navigate`

Only argument is a dictionary with these values. Unlike `react-navigation`, this doesn't currently support a string as argument.

- `routeName`: string, required
- `params`: optional dictionary
- `web`: Optional dictionary with added values for web, following the API from `next/router`'s `Router.push` [function](https://nextjs.org/docs#with-url-object-1).
  - `path`: (optional) Fulfills the same value as `pathname` from `next/router`, overriding the `routeName` field. If you set this to `/cars`, it will navigate to `/cars` instead of the `routeName` field. As a result, it will load the file located at `pages/cars.js`.
  - `as`: (optional) If set, the browser will show this value in the address bar. Useful if you want to show a pretty/custom URL in the address bar that doesn't match the actual path. Unlike the `path` field, this does not affect which route you actually go to.
  - `shallow`: Update the path of the current page without rerunning getStaticProps, getServerSideProps or getInitialProps. Defaults to false

**Example:** Navigate to a user

```es6
export default function Home() {
  const { navigate } = useRouting()

  // goes to yourdomain.com/user?id=chris
  const onPress = () =>
    navigate({
      routeName: 'user',
      params: { id: 'chris' },
    })

  // üëáor thisüëá
  // goes to `yourdomain.com/user/chris`
  const navigateCleanLink = () =>
    navigate({
      routeName: 'user',
      params: { id: 'chris' },
      web: { as: `/user/chris` },
    })

  // üëáor thisüëá
  // 'profile' path overrides 'user' on web, so it uses the pages/profile.js file
  // even though it navigates to yourdomain.com/profile?id=chris?color=blue`
  // ...it actually shows up as yourdomain.com/@chris in the URL bar.
  const navigateCleanLinkWithParam = () =>
    navigate({
      routeName: 'user',
      params: { id: 'chris', color: 'blue' }, // accessed with getParam in the next screen
      web: { as: `/@chris`, path: 'profile' },
    })
}
```

This follows the next pattern of [dynamic routing](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/clean-urls-with-dynamic-routing). You'll need to create a `pages/user/[id].js` file.

For more thoughts on how and when you should use the `web` field, see [Web Thoughts](#web-thoughts).

### `getParam`

[Same API](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/en/navigation-prop.html#getparam-get-a-specific-param-value-with-a-fallback) as `getParam` from react-navigation.

Similar to `query` from `next/router`, except that it's a function to grab the values.

**pages/user/[id].js**

Imagine you navigated to `yourdomain.com/user/chris` on web using the example above.

```es6
export default function User() {
  const { getParam } = useRouting()

  const id = getParam('id') // chris

  // do something with the id
}
```

## `useFocusEffect`

See [react navigation docs](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/en/next/use-focus-effect.html#docsNav). On web, it simply replaces the focus effect with a normal effect hook. On mobile, it is the exact react navigation hook.

Make sure to use [useCallback](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usecallback) as seen in the example.

```es6
import { useFocusEffect } from 'expo-next-react-navigation'

export default ({ userId }) => {
  useFocusEffect(
    useCallback(() => {
      const unsubscribe = API.subscribe(userId, user => setUser(user))

      return () => unsubscribe()
    }, [userId])
  )

  return <Profile userId={userId} />
}
```

## `Link`

The following will use the `chat` route in react navigation.

However, it will use the `pages/room.js` file for nextjs. Also, it will show up as `domain.com/messages` in the address bar.

Optionally accepts a `nextLinkProps` prop dictionary and `touchableOpacityProps` dictionary as well.

```es6
export default function Button() {
  return (
    <Link
      routeName="chat"
      params={{ roomId: '12' }}
      web={{
        path: '/room',
        as: 'messages',
      }}
    >
      Chat in room 12
    </Link>
  )
}
```

**Required props**:

- `routeName`: string, see [`useRouting().navigate`](https://github.com/nandorojo/expo-next-react-navigation#navigate) docs.
- `children`: string

**Optional props**

- `web`: A dictionary with the follwing options:

```ts
type Web = {
  /**
   * Alternative path to override routeName on web.
   */
  path?: string
  /**
   * A custom URL ending to show in the browser address bar instead of the `web.path` or `routeName`.
   *
   * Should start with `/`.
   */
  as?: string
  /**
   * Prefetch the page in the background. Defaults to `true`
   */
  prefetch?: boolean
  /**
   * Scroll to the top of the page after a navigation. Defaults to `true`
   *
   */
  scroll?: boolean
  /**
   * Replace the current history state instead of adding a new url into the stack. Defaults to `false`
   */
  replace?: boolean
  /**
   * Update the path of the current page without rerunning getStaticProps, getServerSideProps or getInitialProps. Defaults to false
   */
  shallow?: boolean
}
```
- `web`: dictionary, see [`useRouting().navigate`](#navigate) docs. On `v1.0.5`+, you can also pass the `prefetch`, `replace`, and `scroll` booleans here, from the `next/link` [component](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/link).

- `touchableOpacityProps`: extends React Native's `TouchableOpacity` props.

- `nextLinkProps`: extends `next/router`'s [Link props](https://nextjs.org/docs#with-link).
- `isText`: if false, you can set the children to be non-Text nodes. Defaults to `true`. If `true`, the children can be a string **or** a `Text` node.

## Other shout outs

### `nextjs-progressbar`

I think this is an awesome package for adding a loading progress bar to your `next` pages. It's super easy. Check it out.

Link: [https://www.npmjs.com/package/nextjs-progressbar](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nextjs-progressbar)

```es6
yarn add nextjs-progressbar

or

npm i nextjs-progressbar
```

**pages/\_app.js**

```es6
import React from 'react'
import App from 'next/app'
import NextNprogress from 'nextjs-progressbar'

class MyApp extends App {
  render() {
    const { Component, pageProps } = this.props
    return (
      <>
        <NextNProgress
          color="#29D"
          startPosition="0.3"
          stopDelayMs="200"
          height="3"
        />
        <Component {...pageProps} />
      </>
    )
  }
}

export default MyApp
```

## Web Thoughts

The `web` prop in the `navigate` function and `Link` component can help provide cleaner urls (`user/mike` instead of `user?id=mike`) on web.

Also, navigation patterns on mobile can be different than web, and this field can help you account for those situations.

For instance, imagine you have a tab navigator. Say the first tab has a nested stack navigator with an inbox screen and a chat room screen. If you navigate from a notifications tab to this tab, and a chat room screen was already open, you probably want that chat room to stay open on mobile. Only if you press the tab button a second time should it pop back to the inbox screen.

This may not be the case on `web`. Web navigation patterns on web may lead you to want to open the inbox directly, instead of the open chat screen. This example could look something like this:

```es6
navigate({
  routeName: 'inboxStack',
  web: {
    path: 'inbox',
  },
})
```

I've also considered letting the `web` field take a `dynamic` parameter like this `chat/:roomId`:

```es6
// goes to `yourdomain.com/chat/chris` and still passes `chris` as a `roomId` param
const navigateCleanLink = () =>
  navigate({
    routeName: 'chat',
    params: { roomId: 'chris' },
    web: { dynamic: `chat/[roomId]` },
  })

// goes to yourdomain.com/chat?roomId=chris
const onPress = () =>
  navigate({
    routeName: 'chat',
    params: { roomId: 'chris' },
  })
```

But that's not added. For now, the same is achieved by doing this:

```es6
const roomId = 'chris'

const navigateToChatRoom = () =>
  navigate({
    routeName: 'chat',
    params: { roomId },
    web: { path: `chat/${roomId}` },
  })
```

This would open the `pages/chat/[roomId].js` file, with `roomId` as a param.
